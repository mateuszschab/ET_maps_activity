## Basic Overview
The purpose of the experiment was to analyze the pattern of the subject's perception of the selected image. Data from the 
test were collected via a Gazepoint GP3 HD ophthalmoscope.
The first map includes the route in which the user traveled through the image, as well as red rings, the diameter of which indicates the time of focus on a particular section. 

## Visualize the results

Determining the heat map allows you to detail the points that caught the user's attention the most. The shortest designated focus point lasted 0.1330 seconds, while the longest lasted 0.9366. This type of map is most often used in the appropriate creation of graphic marketing content.
